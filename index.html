    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        What is an impact consultant? Well firstly it's not an official title but it does best describe the outcome I
        intend to have during engagements.
        Creating value is felt, it's the interactions and activities where you know this is going to have an impact.
        It's these moments that give me the most energy. Working with and participating with my clients while seeing
        their enthusiasm and excitment elevate for the journey ahead is a very satisfying experience.
        Having worked with many types of businesses has allowed me to develop a broad set of skills and knowledge.
        I have held various positions as an operational, commercial, customer service and technological professional.
        This has helped me grow to not be one thing, but understand the needs of many.
        Industries I have worked in include banking, insurance, retail, technology, pharmaceutical, customer service
        (BPO) and marine fuel testing.
        In my current role I help my clients unlock value through analytics by applying a data-driven strategy. Aiding in
        all facets of the development from data extraction, processing to reporting.
        My platform of choice is Qlik. Where i have for more than 10 years delivered numerous
        applications and countless insights.
        Moving forward I have found the world of LowCode to be very exciting and currently pursuing various academic
        courses and smaller projects to fully transition into this space.
        The world of software development is exciting place to be right now!
